\section{A coarsening framework based on HARP}\label{sec:harp}

HARP is a method for improving the performance of graph representation learning algorithms such as DeepWalk \cite{perozzi_deepwalk_2014}, node2vec \cite{grover_node2vec_2016}, or, in general, any algorithm that produces embeddings as a distinct output. The method is a combination of dataset augmentation and pre-training based on the general principle that graph-based models train more efficiently on smaller graphs and can thus be pre-trained on a coarsened representation of the graph at hand. Moreover, the coarsened graphs are able to approximate the global properties of the original data, enabling the representations to better encapsulate such a global structure.

The sequence \( G_0, G_1, G_2, \dots, G_L \) introduced in Section~\ref{sec:performance-complexity} is generated one step at a time, that is, graph \( G_i \) is generated from the graph \( G_{i - 1} \) by coarsening it -- lowering the number of nodes and edges while preserving in some sense the general structure of the graph. Following \cite{chen_harp_2018}, let \( \varphi_i \) denote the mapping \( G_i = \varphi_i \left( G_{i - 1} \right) \). In this work, we restrict the definition of such a coarsening \( \varphi_i \) to only consist of a series of edge contractions. Therefore, each coarsening corresponds to a set \( \mathcal{C} \subseteq E \left( G \right) \), i.e. a subset of edges of the original graph. This description of a graph coarsening is inspired by \cite{schulz_mining_2019}, which is why it differs from the weaker definition of a graph reduction as selecting a subset of nodes and edges \cite{huang_scaling_2021,loukas_graph_2019}.

In an overview, the HARP algorithm consists of the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Dataset augmentation}. The graph \( G \) is consecutively reduced in size by the application of several graph coarsening schemas. In each step, the coarsened graph can be viewed as an ever coarser representation of the graph data and its global structure. This step can be run ahead-of-time to produce the resulting coarsened graphs \( G_0, G_1, \dots, G_L \).
\end{enumerate}
After all the coarsened graphs are pre-computed, the method itself can be executed by repeating the following steps on the graphs from the coarsest to the finest (i.e. from \( G_L \) to \( G_0 \)):
\begin{enumerate}\setcounter{enumi}{1}
  \item \textbf{Training on an intermediary graph}. The graph embedding model is trained on \( G_i \), producing \( \Phi_{G_i} \), an embedding of the graph in a Euclidean space.
  \item \textbf{Embedding prolongation}. The embedding \( \Phi_{G_i} \) is prolonged (i.e. modified to accommodate a finer graph) from the current graph to one that is one step closer to \( G_0 \), yielding \( \Phi_{G_{i - 1}} \). This embedding is used as the starting point for training on \( G_{i - 1} \).
\end{enumerate}
These steps are repeated until \( \Phi_{G_0} \) is computed. While the training step of this schema is a straightforward application of one of the aforementioned embedding algorithms to \( G_i \), the particular details of the coarsening and prolongation steps are further explained in Sections \ref{sec:adaptive-prolongation} and \ref{sec:harp-coarsening}.

The first step is independent of the rest of the computation and can be done ahead of time. The last two steps can be seen as a form of pre-training for the model that is to be learned on the original graph. The whole HARP pipeline is demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:harp-overview}.
