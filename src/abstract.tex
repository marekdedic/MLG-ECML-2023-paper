  Graph based models are used for tasks with increasing size and computational demands. We present a method for node classification that allows a user to precisely select the resolution at which the graph in question should be pretrained. Our method builds on an existing algorithm for pretraining on coarser graphs, HARP. We extend both main parts of the algorithm in order to tune the effect of graph coarsening on the accuracy of node classification on a fine level. We present a framework for graph coarsening, covering, apart from HARP, two alternative algorithms based on graph diffusion convolution. Moreover, we present a novel way for refining the reduced graph in a targeted way based on the node classification confidence of particular nodes. Together, these enhancements provide sufficient detail where needed, while collapsing structures where per-node information is not necessary for sufficient node classification accuracy. Hence, the method provides a meta-model for enhancing graph embedding models such as node2vec. We apply it to several datasets, compare the considered coarsenings on them and discuss the differing behaviour on each of them in the context of their properties.
