\todo{With the removal of alternative coarsening schemas, maybe some of these could be removed?}
The publication most relevant to our research is \cite{chen_harp_2018}, in which the HARP approach is proposed. Because we directly extend and modify this method, it will be recalled in some detail in Section \ref{sec:harp}. Other important works concerning graph coarsening are \cite{akyildiz_understanding_2020,chen_graph_2022,cai_graph_2022}, which survey numerous coarsening methods, \cite{huang_scaling_2021}, which presents results concerning scalability of graph coarsening, \cite{catalyurek_multithreaded_2012,herrmann_multilevel_2019}, which establish coarsening as a basis for partitioning, and \cite{loukas_graph_2019}, which shows relationships of graph coarsening to properties of the Laplacian. In view of the fact that the HARP approach is a multilevel approach, we paid attention also to the multilevel graph coarsening methods proposed in \cite{bethune_hierarchical_2020,xie_graph_2020,zhang_harp_2021,liu_hierarchical_2021}, among them \cite{zhang_harp_2021} also being inspired by HARP.

In a broader context, our research is related to the more general topic of graph reduction, which apart from graph coarsening includes also graph sparsification. A general framework covering both coarsening and sparsification has been proposed in \cite{bravo_hermsdorff_unifying_2019}. Also of note is the recent work \cite{kammer_space-efficient_2022}, presenting an alternative coarsening approach for planar graphs and \cite{liu_comprehensive_2022}, which sparsifies not only the graph topology, but simultaneously also the features of its nodes and weights of graph neural network used for its embedding. Elaboration of graph coarsening methods in machine learning can build on several decades of their succesful application, such as pairwise aggregation, independent sets, or algebraic distance, in numerical linear algebra \cite{chen_graph_2022}, including in particular multilevel graph coarsening \cite{osei-kuffuor_matrix_2015,ubaru_sampling_2019}.
