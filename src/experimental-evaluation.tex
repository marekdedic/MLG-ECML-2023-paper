\section{Experimental evaluation}\label{sec:experimental-evaluation}

The proposed methods were experimentally verified on 10 publicly available datasets. The datasets Cora and CiteSeer \cite{yang_revisiting_2016} were used with the \enquote{full} train-test split as in \cite{chen_fastgcn_2018}. In addition, 2 variants of the Twitch dataset \cite{rozemberczki_multi-scale_2021} with the hignest node count (DE and EN) were used. Five medium sized datasets were also used, the PubMed dataset \cite{yang_revisiting_2016}, the DBLP dataset \cite{bojchevski_deep_2018}, the IMDB dataset \cite{fu_magnn_2020} and both variants of the Coauthor dataset \cite{shchur_pitfalls_2019}. Finally, one large dataset was used, the OGB ArXiv dataset \cite{hu_open_2021}.

The hyper-parameters for both the node2vec model used for the embedding training and the multi-layer perceptron used for downstream classification were initially set to values used in prior art (see \cite{hu_open_2021,fey_fast_2019}) and then manually fine-tuned for each dataset.

The achitecture of the algorithm was identical accross the dataset, with the only difference being in the values of the hyper-parameters. For the Cora dataset, the node2vec model generated an embedding in \( \mathfield{R}^{128} \) from \( 4 \) random walks of length \( 20 \) for each node with a context window of size \( 5 \). The optimizer ADAM \cite{kingma_adam:_2017} was used with a learning rate of \( 0.01 \) and batches of \( 128 \) samples. The model was trained for \( 5 \) epochs and in each step of the adaptive prolongation, \( 100 \) nodes were prolonged, until reaching the original graph (the value of \( n_p \) was calculated so that the total number of training epochs would match baseline model training). The MLP classifier using the embeddings featured \( 3 \) linear layers of \( 128 \) neurons with batch normalization after each layer. Each layer was normalized using dropout \cite{srivastava_dropout_2014} with the rate of \( 0.5 \). Finally, a linear layer was used for the class prediction. For the classifier, ADAM with a learning rate of \( 0.01 \) was used for \( 30 \) epochs of training with the cross-entropy loss function. Dataset features weren't used for the classifier training as the aim of this work is to compare the embeddings. The experiment was run \( 10 \) times end-to-end and results averaged. The experiments were implemented using PyTorch \cite{paszke_pytorch_2019} and PyTorch Geometric \cite{fey_fast_2019}.

In order to study the effect of adaptive prolongation, the method was used to assess the performance of downstream transductive classification at different coarsening levels. For each prolongation step, the intermediary embedding was fully prolonged to obtain an embedding of the original graph \( G \). A classifier was then trained with this embedding as input. This setup allows us to compare classification accuracy at each step of the adaptive prolongation. Figure~\ref{fig:adaptive-coarsening} shows the results of this experiment, compared with a baseline node2vec model (that is, without any coarsening or prolongation) that was trained for the same number of epochs as the total epochs of the adaptive model over all prolongation steps.

The results are averaged over multiple runs, with the solid line representing the mean and the shaded area denoting one standard deviation.}

Following recent best-practice recommendations regarding verifying the statistical validity of results \cite{benavoli_time_2017}, the results were studied from the point of view of Bayesian estimation. The performance of the model was compared to that of the baseline model at \( k \)-th deciles of the node count, for all possible values of \( k \). The comparison was done using the Bayesian Wilcoxon signed-rank test \cite{benavoli_bayesian_2014} for 3 different widths of the region of practical equivalence (ROPE), 1\%, 5\% and 10\%. The probabilities that the two models are practically equivalent are listed in Table~\ref{tab:bayesian-adaptive}. Of a particular note is the fact that  at 60\% complexity, the models have over a 99\% probability of being within 10 percentage points of performance and at 80\% complexity, they have over 99\% probability of being withing 5 percentage points of performance. This shows that the proposed method may offer a significant complexity reduction in exchange for a relatively minor decrease in performance.
